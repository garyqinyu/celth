<p>This file contains summary notes documenting changes made by PEG developers 
 for the last several interim releases of the PEG library.  </p>
   
<p><b><i>To Our Valued Customers,</i></b>  </p>
   
<p>Swell Software makes every reasonable effort to insure that new releases 
 are fully compatible with existing applications, as we do not take trivially 
 the effort and inconvenience caused by forcing changes to your existing software.
Still, there are occasions when significant feature upgrades are best implemented
by modifying existing classes. Code size and execution speed are and will
always be among our top priorities, as we believe this is in the long term
best interest of all concerned.  </p>
   
<p>This file summarizes all significant changes, enhancements, bug fixes, 
 or other modifications. This file does not replace the programming and reference
 manual, but is provided for convenience and is intended to minimize the
time  spent searching for changes that may affect your system software. 
</p>
   
<p>Changes which may affect existing applications are highlighted with the
 bullet style shown below: <br>
  <img src="bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   This bullet marks a change that may affect your existing software. <br>
  <img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   This bullet marks an enhancement that will not affect existing software. 
  </p>
   
<p>We hope that these notes minimize any difficulty you experience in updating 
 to a new release of the PEG library. Remember that the majority of our enhancements
 are driven by customer requests, so feel free to give us your feedback.
As  always, should you have any problems we encourage you to contact Swell
Software,  Inc.  </p>
   
<p>Sincerely,  </p>

  <b><u><font size="+1">Release 1.82</font></u></b>    
<p><img src="bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added horizontal and vertical cell justification in the PegTable class.
 This enhancement changes the PegTable::SetCellClient method by replacing
the  BOOL bForceFit parameter to a WORD wStyle parameter. Please see the
 reference material for the PegTable class for a complete description of
the new style flags.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Improved the PegStripChart class by allowing each line being displayed 
to  set it's own leader color. The method PegStripChart::SetLeaderColor has 
been removed and superseded by PegStripChart::SetLineLeaderColor.</p>
   
<p><img src="file:///H:/peg/manual/html/bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Improved the image conversion classes (pimgconv, pjpgconv, pgifconv, pbmpconv,
 ppngconv) to properly support 16bpp and 24bpp output formats without losing
 color information. The API for retrieving the resulting PegBitmap(s) has
been changed to GetBitmapPointer(index), instead of returning an array of
PegBitmap pointers.</p>
   
<p>  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed path parsing problem in the PegImageConvert utility causing strange 
 output bitmap names.</p>
 
<p></p>
 
<p><img src="file:///H:/peg/manual/html/bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
  Fixed bug in viewport update routines that was revealed when a new PegWindow 
was added to an already visible but partially hidden parent window. The new 
window was allowed to show above the window obscuring the parent window.</p>
 
<p><img src="file:///H:/peg/manual/html/bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
  Changed the 16 level grayscale palette to a linear grayscale palette, meaning 
equal steps from black to white. The older palette matched the VGA color palette
luminance values. The new linear palette provides a nicer looking image and
more gray levels for bitmapped images.</p>
   
<p><img src="file:///H:/peg/manual/html/bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Improved speed of drawing angled lines by moving the clipping test outside
 of the inner loop for lines that do not need to be clipped..  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added more key handling to PegComoBox, making it possible to open and
close  a combo-box using the keyboard.</p>
<p><img src="file:///H:/peg/manual/html/bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added new messages "PM_GAINED_KEYBOARD" and "PM_LOST_KEYBOARD" to indicate
when an object gains and loses keyboard input focus. This message is only
defined when PEG_KEYBOARD_SUPPORT is defined. This message is more specific
than PM_CURRENT, because it is sent only to the input focus object rather
than to all objects in the active branch of the current or active display
tree.<br>
  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Modified directional (i.e. arrow) key handling to ignore groups, making
 the directional moves more intuitive.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added configuration flag "PEG_ARROW_KEY_SUPPORT" to modify key handling
 for systems with a keyboard or keypad, but which may or may not include
arrow  keys.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added new Protected Mode Generic SuperVGA screen driver. This screen driver
 is for x86 systems only, running in 32-bit protected mode. This driver provides 
 generic support for all PCI video cards in x86 systems at 640x480, 800x600,
  and 1024x768 resolution at 256 colors.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added FreeType (Internal) True Type font rasterizer support to the FontCapture 
 utility program.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Changed FontCapture utility to preview all font pages before saving the 
generated font.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Changed WindowBuilder Reduced-Font writer to record each font's page height, 
 instead of using first page height for all pages.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Improved Polygon filling algorithm to properly handle all known convex 
and  concave polygons. Tested with polygons having many hundreds of points 
and  all sorts of strange shared edges, holes, etc..   </p>
   
<p>   </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added example program named "Bolas", an artificial intelligence marble 
game.   </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Many improvements and bug fixes to the PRESS execution model including 
locally (server side) registering and unregistering of font and bitmap resources.
 Unicode font resource handling was also added allowing client applications
 to register large, multi-paged, Unicode fonts on the server.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added support for the PEG utilities (WindowBuilder, FontCapture and  ImageConvert)
 to run on the X11/Solaris Intel platform.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added support for running PEG Remote Screen Client (PRESC) applications 
on the Solaris Intel platform.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added support for the Epson S1D13A03/4/5 family of video controllers.
 </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Corrected bitmap display problem with PegMessageWindow class.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added a new PegMLMessageWindow class that allows for multiline messages
 to be displayed in a message box.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Many improvements to the PegChart class and it's derivatives to more efficiently
 draw the data lines and optional components of the chart.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed bug in PegTextBox where the width of the textbox is smaller than 
the width of a single character, causing an infinite loop.<br>
  </p>
   
<p><img src="file:///H:/peg/manual/html/bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Improved tab order definition and maitenance methods. A new function PegThing::SetDefaultTabLinks
 is now called to establish tab order based on top-to-bottom, left-to-right
 child control position. The function PegThing::SetTabOrder has also been
added to allow the application to specify a unique specific tab order.</p>
   
<p></p>
   
<p><img src="file:///H:/peg/manual/html/bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
  &nbsp;  Improved methods for keeping track of which child object has input
 focus when the parent window loses and regains focus. In many cases this
eliminates the need to use PegPresentationManager::MoveFocusTree() to move
focus to the desired object. For applications which create multi-level menu
systems using PegWindow derived objects, this greatly simplifies the code
required to exit out of nested menus and keep focus on the most recent selection.</p>
   
<p><img src="file:///H:/peg/manual/html/bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
    Fixed bug in PegTextBox where the width of the textbox is smaller than
 the width of a single character, causing an infinite loop.  </p>
   
<p> </p>
   
<hr size="4" width="100%"> <br>
  <b><u><font size="+1">Release 1.80</font></u></b>    
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added public functions HidePointer, AddPointerType, and GetPointerPosition
 to PegScreen class.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Moved the file \include\pvecfont.hpp to \source\pvecfont.cpp. This file
 should be added to the PEG library make file if you are using vector fonts. 
  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Moved the file \include\pal256.hpp to \source\pal256.cpp. This file should
 be added to the PEG library make if you are using the default 256 color
palette.   </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   First release of HP-PCL3 Printer Driver support.   </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   First release of Anti-aliased line drawing support. Currently only supported 
 in 16-bit (65K colors) screen driver. Support will be added to other screen 
 drivers where possible.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Changed PegThing::Add and PegThing::AddToEnd functions to insure that
objects  that are Viewport owners stay in front of objects that are not viewport
owners.  This will potentially cause subtle changes in working applications.
This modification was required for correct operation of heavily nested PegWindow/PegButton
combinations running on top of one another.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   PegThing::Presentation(), PegThing::MessageQueue(), and PegThing::Screen
 are now static functions (as they always should have been).  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed bug in viewport update routines that in certain cases allowed background 
 viewport owners to show above forground objects.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed warnings in PNG decoder (ppngcon.cpp) and PegZip (pzip.cpp) modules 
 for certain compilers.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added integration for Mentor Graphics VRTX operating system.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added support for Intel "Extensible Firmware Interface" (EFI) port of
PEG.  There is now a PEG-based kit available for writing graphical BIOS extensions 
 for Itanium-based computer systems.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed virtual (bitmap) drawing to allow non-visible objects to draw to 
a bitmap.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed bug in Circle and Arc clipping for virtual (bitmap) drawing.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added support for changing color of selected tab in PegNotebook class. 
 </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added support Japanese Front End Processor. When editing the WindowBuilder 
 string table, you can now use the FEP to input Kanji characters and these 
 are accepted as normal character input by PEG.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Modified FontCapture to seperate capture and save operations. You can
now  preview many captured fonts, and save those you want to keep. Simple
editing  capability is scheduled for the next release. Improved speed of
capture of  BDF formatted fonts. Improved conversion algorithm and character
positioning  for BDF formatted fonts. Improved Outline Font generation and
preview capabilities.   </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Improved PegHScroll and PegVScroll to set a minimum scroll button size. 
  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Greatly improved WindowBuilder stability, especially related to String 
Table editor.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed bug in Merge facility of String Table Editor causing missed strings. 
  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added Import facility to StringTable editor. This is similar to Merge, 
the strings from the merged table are added to the current table instead 
of looking for duplicate string IDs as the Merge facilty does. Import is used
 to create a "master string table" from several smaller tables created by
developers working on different parts of an application.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added sort command to String Table Editor.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed memory leak in PegEditBox::CopyToScratchpad.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added persistence to PatternLine and made the pattern parameter optional. 
 This improves the appearance if drawing many short pattern lines, because
  the pattern doesn't reset and start over with every short line.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Removed use of floating point from run-time JPG conversion class (pjpgconv.cpp) 
 if PEG_FP_GRAPHICS is not defined.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed several minor bugs in WindowBuilder code generator.            
                                              </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added PS/2 mouse support (including MS Intellimouse with wheel messages)
 to the PEG Linux integration for x86 platforms. This is the new default
type  (instead of serial mice) for running PEG on Linux. The defines for
changing  this behavior and selecting the appropriate mouse type are in the
file /peg/source/linuxpeg.cpp.   </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added PS/2 mouse support for LynxOS on x86 hardware. The MS Intellimouse
 is supported, but the LynxOS mouse driver does not provide "wheel" information,
 therefore, the driver treats all PS/2 mice as 2 button MS generic mouse
devices.   </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added X11 Development Platform support for LynxOS. This has been tested
 with the default LynxOS MetroLink X Server and Lynx PosixWorks Desktop environment. 
  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added X11 Development Platform support for x86 Sun Solaris 8 (07/01).
This  has been tested with the X server and CDE that ships with Solaris.
 </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Moved the "_REENTRANT" define that is necessary when building with POSIX 
 compliant operating systems (such as Linux, LynxOS and Solaris) to the gcc
 command line and out of the PEG header files. This ensures that this define
 is applied to all PEG library and applications building on these platforms
 in the  proper fashion. All of the appropriate make files have been updated.
 For customers building on any of these operating systems with older make
files, you must add the "_REENTRANT" define to your existing make files.
For an example of this, see any of the make files for the PEG library specific
to your operating system.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Updated the PEG Remote Screen Server and PEG Remote Screen Client integrations 
 from Alpha to Beta status. Most of the run time issues have been resolved
 and the accompanying documentation is nearly completed. This will be production 
 ready software by the next release.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added support for the Cirrus Logic EDB7312 development board including 
support  for the BurrBrown ADS 7846 touch controller and front panel user 
keys.  </p>
   
<p> </p>
   
<hr size="4" width="100%"> <br>
  <b><u><font size="+1">Release 1.79</font></u></b>   
<p>In house release  </p>
   
<p> </p>
   
<hr size="4" width="100%"> <br>
  <b><u><font size="+1">Release 1.78</font></u></b>   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed problem with Win32 utilities that left an automatic testing feature 
 enabled, causing large files to be place on the system running the utility. 
  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed problem with filled Arc drawing causing strange results.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed problem with Arc and Ellipse clipping.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Updated Lynx integration to support multi-threading.  </p>
   
<p> </p>
   
<hr size="4" width="100%"> <br>
  <b><u><font size="+1">Release 1.76</font></u></b>   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added Multi-process support for MMU enabled operating systems via new
remote  screen server. (ie. INTEGRITY, Linux, LynxOS, Enea-OSE...)  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added PEG_ZIP and PEG_UNZIP data compress/restore fucntionality. These 
classes  are used for PNG graphics file support, but can also be used as general
purpose data compression for application data.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added new flags to turn on/off image conversions. This enables the user
 to turn on only a specific conversion type, instead of grouping them all
together.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added Grayscale weighting algorithm to ImageConvert utility, improved
grayscale  support in 4-bit screen drivers.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Improved speed of color matching for run-time image conversion using 4-bit 
 (16 color) screen drivers.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added the ability to dump any part of the screen to a Windows bitmap file. 
 This has commonly been requested for use in product literature. This feature 
 is enabled by turning on the new PEG_BITMAP_WRITER definition.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added Support for Enea-OSE operating system. Current supported targets 
include  Softkernel and MPC823. Others to follow.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added Support for Precise-MQX operating system.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added Permedia2, MediaQ MQ200, Epson1386, and StrongARM screen drivers. 
  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added support for right-justified text in PegTextBox.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Modified large-font support to eliminate the 16-bit offset limitation. 
PEG can now support a font of any number of characters, of any total size. 
Very large fonts are now divided into multiple pages. These pages are linked 
together to form one font. This process happens automatically when you run 
FontCapture  or WindowBuilder, but it did require a modification to every 
existing screen driver. If you are using PEG_UNICODE and you have created 
your own screen driver, you should compare the DrawText routine in your driver 
with the same function in the driver template.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   The multi-page font modification described above causes an incompatibiliy 
 between the new and previous WindowBuilder project file. If you have a Unicode-Enabled
 WindowBuilder project, Open that project with the previous version of Window
 Builder. Delete the sub-fonts from any Composite fonts and then remove the
 composite fonts from the project. Save the project. You can now open the
project with the new WindowBuilder and re-add your composite fonts. NOTE:
Your string tables will NOT be corrupted, you will NOT lose any existing
string translations.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added support for "Paste From Clipboard" command in WindowBuilder string
 table editor. This enabled users inputting Asian or other complex characters
 to use the Front End Processor provided with Windows to input characters
into the  WindowBuilder string table. Use the right mouse button over the
string table to invoke the new "Paste From Clipboard" command.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed bug in ALWAYS_ON_TOP status flag handling that allowed these ALWAYS_ON_TOP
 objects to be covered..  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Modified keyboard-driven menu handling to allow wrap-around of menus when 
 using the keyboard.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed bug in Viewport Management that allowed Viewport and Non-Viewport 
siblings to be drawn in the wrong Z-order. Only occured if a Viewport owner 
overlapped a non-viewport sibling object.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Fixed bug in PegString that allowed a string to exceed the maximum length
 if assigned using DataSet().  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added user-defined palette management to ImageConvert utility.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added PNG file support to ImageConvert utility and to run-time image conversion
 classes.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added character filter file capability to FontCapture utility program. 
Modified internal operation to eliminate screen dependencies.   </p>
   
<p> </p>
   
<hr size="4" width="100%"> <br>
  <b><u><font size="+1">Release 1.75</font></u></b>    
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added the following HMI gadgets to the core library: </p>
   
<ul>
       <li>PegLinearScale     </li>
    <li>PegLinearBitmapScale     </li>
    <li>PegFiniteDial     </li>
    <li>PegFiniteBitmapDial     </li>
    <li>PegColorLight     </li>
    <li>PegColorBitmapLight </li>
   
</ul>
      
<p><img src="bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Due to name clashes with the X11 libraries, some of the public PegTreeNode 
 method names were changed. Below is a list of the member methods that changed: 
 </p>
   
<ul>
       <li>PegTreeNode* Above() to PegTreeNode* NodeAbove()     </li>
    <li>PegTreeNode* Below() to PegTreeNode* NodeBelow()     </li>
    <li>PegTreeNode* Bottom() to PegTreeNode* NodeBottom() </li>
   
</ul>
      
<p><img src="bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Updated the charting classes to allow for dual Y axis labels, major and
  minor tick marks and discrentionary positioning of the X axis tics and
 labels along the Y axis.  </p>
   
<p> These changes affect some of the inline member methods of the base PegChart
 class. Specifically the Get and Set methods for the tic marks. The general
 methods have been replaced by methods specific to the  major and minor tic
 marks. See the new pegchart.hpp file for details.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added the PegToolBar and PegToolBarPanel objects.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added support for the PowerPC823 Motorla FADS reference platform.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">

   <b>Important: </b>Modified<b> <i><u>ALL</u></i></b> RTOS integrations
such  that the new types PEG_TASK_TYPE and PEG_QUEUE_TYPE are required. This
improves  the readability and eliminates the type-casting that was required
when generic  "void *" data types were used. This change requires that anyone
updating to this release who is using a supported RTOS must obtain new integration
files. Please email support@swellsoftware.com if you need an updated version
of your RTOS integration files. For privacy reasons they are NOT included
in our core library release.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Modified directory structure. The \peg\build directory now contains all
 supported DOS and Win32 make files for all supported compilers. Due to the
 very large number of compilers and CPUs now supported, the remaining compiler/target/RTOS
 specific make files are NOT included in the core library release. If you
need assistance configuring your project for a particular compiler/target/RTOS,
 please email support@swellsoftware.com. We will be happy to send you a library 
 makefile and example program makefile for any supported compiler or hardware 
 reference platform. As always new users of PEG receive the make files and 
 examples for the specific compiler/RTOS/target specified at time of purchase.

   Created new sub-directories for PegScreen derived screen drivers. These
 drivers are once again included in each PEG release.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   First release of the PegChart classes. These classes include PegChart, 
PegLineChart, PegStripChart, and PegMultiLineChart.  </p>

   Improved performance of Cirrus Logic screen driver and Chips&amp;Technologies
 65545 screen driver.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added Video Memory Manager. This feature is automatically turned on when
 using a hardware-accelerated screen driver. This allows bitmaps created
with  CreateBitmap() to be placed in unused video memory, and displayed using
hardware  BitBlt capability. This is used for very fast animations or Sprite
display.   </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   <b>Important: </b>Added DestroyBitmap() function to all screen drivers.
 This is the opposite of the CreateBitmap() function. Any PegBitmap created
 by calling the CreateBitmap() function must now be deleted using the DestroyBitmap()
 function. This is required to allow consistent operation with systems running
 with our without the Video Memory Manager.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added CreatePegScreen() function to all screen drivers. This simplifies
 ALL of the OS integration and standalone PegTask implementations. The PegTask
 startup code no longer needs to know which screen driver is being used,
but  simply calls CreatePegScreen(), the implementation of which is determined
 by which screen driver has been linked into your system.  </p>

  <b><u><font size="+1">Release 1.68</font></u></b>    
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Removed chip-specific PegScreen classes from the core distribution. <i>
 This was done only to reduce the number of files included in the core distribution</i>
  . Since the number of video controllers supported is steadily increasing,
 including every PegScreen class in the core distribution adds unnecessary
 complexity for new users. All PegScreen classes developed by Swell Software
 are still available to all users of PEG. If you need a PegScreen class for
 a specific video controller, contact us to see if we have a version available
 for your system. We are re-working the online support page to provide a
seperate  listing and download area for chip-specific PegScreen classes.

<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Much work on improved operation with keyboard input only, eliminating
much  of the application level coding required in previous versions. PEG_KEYBOARD_SUPPORT,
 when turned on, now includes support for operating menus, switching between
 windows and child controls, closing windows, etc.. The &lt;TAB&gt; and &lt;Shift+TAB&gt;
 keys can now be used to move in forward and reverse directions through the
 child controls. The &lt;CTRL+TAB&gt; key will cycle top-level windows, and
 the &lt;F1&gt; key will activate a PegDecoratedWindow menu bar. Default
arrow  key and enter key handling are also provided.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Greatly simplified the \peg\examples\keyboard example program to take
advantage  of the new keyboard input handling methods.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Modified default operation when an object is added to the current window.
 In previous releases, adding an object to the current window (i.e. the window
 with input focus) did not by default move focus to the new object. This
has  been changed such that if an object is added to a visible window, and
that  window has input focus, the new object gains input focus. This eliminates
 the need (in most cases) to call the PresentationManager::MoveFocusTree()
 function.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added PEG_DRAW_FOCUS configuration flag, which forces all controls to
draw  themselves differently when they have input focus. This is an independent
 configuration flag, but would normally be turned on when PEG_KEYBOARD_SUPPORT
 is turned on and turned off otherwise.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added 256 color palette to WindowBuilder.  </p>

   Fixed bug in WindowBuilder code generation for PegDialog titles. The title
 buttons (system button, close button, etc..) were not set correctly for
PegTitle  objects added to PegDialog windows.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Modified PegWindow and PegPresentationManager to insure that the first 
control on a Window receives input focus when a window receives focus.  </p>

   Reversed direction of PegSpinButton messages. "Up" or "Right" buttons
now  send PSF_SPIN_MORE signals, and "Down" and "Left" buttons send PSF_SPIN_LESS
 signals. Most users felt that this was the natural direction of operation.
 If you are catching PSF_SPIN_MORE or PSF_SPIN_LESS signals in your application
 code, you will need to reverse the logic for these signals.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Completed changes to keyboard drivers. Now driver level software only
sends  scan codes and flags to the higher level keyboard handler. PEG determines
 the scan code to key value mapping using a keytable found in the file \peg\include\pegkeys.hpp. 
  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Continued integration of UNICODE support. The core PEG library now fully
 supports 16-bit character encoding. FontCapture has also been upgraded to
 support UNICODE. WindowBuilder enhancements related to UNICODE are in progress.
 These changes have no effect unless you turn on the definition PEG_UNICODE
 in the header file \peg\include\peg.hpp.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Modified FontCapture to automatically save a list of capture ranges to 
a file. FontCapture now starts up with the character range definition used
 during the previous session.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added UNICODE to Absolute mapping table to header of generated font files. 
  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Merging and testing of internal version of standard string library functions
 for UNICODE. This enables PEG to run in UNICODE mode even with toolsets
that  do not support UNICODE. Also allows PEG to run standalone in environments
 where the compiler-provided run-time library is not useful for embedded
targets.   </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Re-definition of all internal strings for either ASCII or UNICODE mode 
of operation. All strings used internally by the library are now defined in
the file \peg\source\pliteral.cpp.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added new "relative positioning" construction methods to WindowBuilder.
 The old method DID allow an object to be re-positioned prior to display
using  the Resize() function, however this was inconvenient and confusing.
The new  method allows the caller to specify the top-left corner for positioning
the  window or dialog. Relative positioning is now enabled by default. Absolute
 postioning can still be used on a module by module basis by selecting the
 "Absolute Positioning" checkbox in the WindowBuilder module properties dialog. 
  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added language configuration dialog to WindowBuilder.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Further improvements in PegList classes, providing better support for
modifications  made a run time while the list is visible.  </p>

<p><b><u><font size="+1">Release 1.59</font></u></b>  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
  Added sending messages for SHIFT, CTRL, ALT, SCROLL, NUMLOCK, etc... This
 is required for Java AWT support. This can be disabled by turning off SEND_ALL_KEYS
 in the header file \peg\include\pegkeys.hpp. Moved PEG extended key definitions
 to new header file \peg\include\pegkeys.hpp.  </p>

<p><b><u><font size="+1">Release 1.58</font></u></b>  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Modified PegBitmap structure. The structure now contains a 32-bit transparency
 value, used only when running with &gt; 256 colors. Also renamed&nbsp; the
 uType field to uFlags, which now contains an ORing of different bitmap flags.
 All bitmaps must be re-generated with ImageConvert to update to this version. 
  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added new off-screen drawing capability. This allows all normal drawing
 functions to be used to draw into a private PegBitmap, which can then be
transferred to the screen. Added related documentation to chapter 8 of programming
manual, along with new example program \peg\examples\guage.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added new functions to PegMenuButton that ease programming effort required
 to dynamically construct PegMenu and PegMenuDescription.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Change the name of the generic VGA screen driver module from d16scrn.cpp
 (.hpp) to vgascrn.cpp (.hpp). Also removed screen driver header from the
list of includes in \peg\include\peg.hpp. The driver in use only needs to
be know by the startup module, and we have moved the driver header to this
module.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Modified internal LOCK_PEG and UNLOCK_PEG structure so that the application
 software no longer has to invoke LOCK or UNLOCK directly. If you are running
 with an integrated RTOS, you will need to request an update to your integration
 package to use this new feature.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added new linear screen driver templates for all common resolutions/color
 depths.  </p>

   Added PM_KEY_RELEASE message, also added 'ctrl', 'alt', and 'shift' flags
 to both PM_KEY and PM_KEY_RELEASE messages. Users running with an integrated
 RTOS package must request an integration package update to use this new
feature.   </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Defined new PEGCHAR data type, required for UNICODE support. Defined as
 type 'char' by default; defined as type 'SIGNED' for UNICODE.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Defined new COLORVAL data type. This data type is defined as 8-bits for
 most systems, but can be defined as 16 or 32 bits for hi-color systems.
 </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added support for run-time color depth determination. Disabled by default.

   Added new graphical keyboard example program. This example should prove
 useful for touch-screen or <b><i>"input-challenged"</i></b> applications.
 This is a full qwerty keyboard that can operate with a mouse or with only
 5 input keys (left,right,up,down,enter).  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added WSM_CONTINUOUS scrolliing mode.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Improved internal viewport maintenance methods. This improves drawing
speed,  and also improves the MULTITHREAD execution model. The screen locking
semaphore  is now only invoked when drawing actually occurs, and the user-level
code  is no longer required to call LOCK_PEG and UNLOCK_PEG under the MULTITHREAD
 model.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added outline font generation capability to FontCapture. This is a 2-bpp
 format font that has a single pixel wide outline around each character.
This  was requested by users who desired to display PEG text over real video,
similar  to the "MTV" or "VH1" logo. Using this new font format requires
that your  screen interface class recognize and support 2-bpp fonts. We have
added this  support to PegWinScreen for reference.  </p>
   
<p>Note: Outline fonts can only be generated from TrueType fonts.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Modified PegScreen base class to include all common functionality. This
 will require that anyone who has created a custom screen driver will have
 to remove any functions that have been relocated to PegScreen.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet1.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Improved operation, API, and speed of PegList derived classes (PegVertList,

 client objects.  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added 3 YAFs for mouse, keyboard, and touch screen support. Touch screen
 users should no longer be required to make ANY mods to core library. Also
 removed keyboard message processing when PEG_KEYBOARD_SUPPORT is not defined. 
  </p>
   
<p><img src="bullet3.jpg" height="11" width="12">
   Added accessor function PegPresentationManager::GetCurrentThing() to obtain

   Modified PegTextThing <b>IMPORTANT</b> PegTextThing derived classes (PegPrompt,
 PegString, PegTextBox, etc..) no longer copy the assigned string constant.
 For most controls this has no effect other than reducing run-time memory
requirements. However<b><i>, if you have ANY controls for which you are calling
DataSet()</i></b> , and passing the address of a string that is in volatile
memory (i.e. the string was built on the stack, or in any memory area that
may change after the call to DataSet(), <b><i>you MUST use the TT_COPY style
flag</i></b> when that control is constructed. The TT_COPY style flag forces
the PegTextThing to work exactly as before, and copy the string data to a
private area. The TT_COPY flag should only be used when you are using functions
like <b>sprintf</b>  or <b>itoa </b>build strings that are passed to DataSet().
 If you only pass string literals, such as </p>
