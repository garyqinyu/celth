<B>Hello!</B>

<P>We thank you for choosing to evaluation the PEG real-time GUI package.
We believe that PEG is simply the smallest, fastest, and easiest to use
package avialable for real-time graphical user interface development.

<P>This diskette, named "demdisk1",&nbsp; contains the following:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
This introduction.</LI>

<LI>
The <A HREF="../../WebSite/publisher/pegbrief.htm">PEG product brief</A>,
a summary data sheet containing important information about PEG.</LI>

<LI>
The PEG programming manual in HTML format.</LI>

<LI>
The PEG reference manual in HTML format.</LI>

<LI>
Demonstration of PEG WindowBuilder, a visual window design tool used with
PEG.</LI>
</UL>
The second diskette, named "demdisk2", contains several PEG example programs.
Each of these programs are built to run under the Windows operating system,
however they can also be built to run on your target with your operating
system.

<BR><B>Installation</B>

<P>To install the remaining files on this disk, you will need to use either
PKUNZIP or WinZip to extract the enclosed ZIP files to your computer. Unzip
the files contained on each disk&nbsp; into any root directory of your
choosing. <B><I>Please be sure to use the "-d" or "Use Folder Names" option
when extracting the enclosed files, since the demonstration programs produce
several sub-directories under the root installation folder.</I></B>

<P>

<BR><B>For More Information:</B>

<P>To order PEG or to obtain further information, please contact:

<BR><B>Demonstration Files</B>
<BR>Once you have extracted the zipped files, you will find the following
sub-directories under your root installation folder:

<P><B>\peg\utils\wb: </B>This directory contains the WindowBuilder executable
program, <B>pwinbld.exe</B>, along with a short tutorial that will help
you begin using this powerful tool.

<P><B>\peg\manual: </B>This directory contains the PegX programming and
reference manuals. You can browse any part of the documention by simply
opening the file <B><I>index.htm</I></B> in your favorite browser.

<P><B>\peg\examples: </B>This directory contains several sub-folders. Each
sub-folder contains a working PEG application program built to run under
Windows. This is a standard environment supported by PEG, enabling you
to do nearly all of your user interface development before your target
hardware becomes available.

<P>The example programs, while generally simple, are intended to demonstrate
some basic features of PEG. The programs include the following:

<P><B>\graphics</B>
<BR>This program demonstrates the use of several PEG drawing primitives.
The drawing primitives use various colors, line and border widths, and
fill styles. This program also demonstrates overlapping, resizable windows.

<P><B>\guage</B>
<BR>This program demonstrates the use of PegBitmap and double-buffered
drawing techniques. Using double-buffering allows smooth, flicker free
animations.

<P><B>\pegdemo</B>
<BR>This program demonstrates many of the standard controls and windows
available in the PEG class library.

<P><B>\robot</B>
<BR>This program demonstrates the use of PegImageConvert to produce an
optimal color palette for the display of high-color depth images.
