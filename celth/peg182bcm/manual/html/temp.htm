<IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Modified the format in which
new releases are posted. The core library, ImageConvert, FontCapture, and
WindowBuilder are now each posted as individual components available for
download. This change simplifies our internal testing and release procedures,
and enables us to post enhancements more quickly. Seperate release notes
are now provided for each component, further simplifying the release, download,
and update process.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Created new sub-directories
for PegScreen derived screen drivers. These drivers are once again included
in each PEG release.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Added Profile-Mode screen
driver templates. These templates allow PEG do be used with a screen that
has been mounted in a rotated or profile orientation.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Added SED1356 screeen driver.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Improved performance of Cirrus
Logic screen driver and Chips&amp;Technologies 65545 screen driver.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Added Video Memory Manager.
This feature is automatically turned on when using a hardware-accelerated
screen driver. This allows bitmaps created with CreateBitmap() to be placed
in unused video memory, and displayed using hardware BitBlt capability.
This is used for very fast animations or Sprite display.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet1.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> <B>Important: </B>Added DestroyBitmap()
function to all screen drivers. This is the opposite of the CreateBitmap()
function. Any PegBitmap created by calling the CreateBitmap() function
must now be deleted using the DestroyBitmap() function. This is required
to allow consistent operation with systems running with our without the
Video Memory Manager.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Added CreatePegScreen() function
to all screen drivers. This simplifies ALL of the OS integration and standalone
PegTask implementations. The PegTask startup code no longer needs to know
which screen driver is being used, but simply calls CreatePegScreen(),
the implementation of which is determined by which screen driver has been
linked into your system.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Added SDS CrossCode compiler
to our verification list.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Added several new example
programs.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Added support for run-time
image scaling. Images can now be resized at run time to any&nbsp; x-y resolution.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Added a new configuration
flag, PEG_AWT_SUPPORT, that turns on several features required for supporting
the Java AWT specification. Also modifies the operation of certain internal
clipping functions.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Fix bug in DRAW_FOCUS operation
that allowed multiple objects to be drawn as if they owned input focus.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Improved documentation of
settings available for fine-tuning touch screen operation.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> PegSpreadSheet: Added new
member functions and improved overall operation.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> PegTextBox: Restructured
to use double-buffered drawing techniques. This improves the appearance
and eliminates flashing perceived when editing text.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> PegString: Restructured to
use double-buffered drawing techniques. This improves the appearance and
eliminates flashing perceived when editing text.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Added Eliptical Arc function
when running in PEG_AWT_SUPPORT mode.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Added general XOR drawing
capability, also intended for use when running in PEG_AWT_SUPPORT mode.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet3.jpg" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=12> Added GetBitmapPixel() and
PutBitmapPixel() functions, used to modify individual pixels in off-screen
bitmaps.
