<P>The developers at Swell Software, Inc. are committed to making PEG the
best embedded GUI solution available at any price. We are also firmly committed
to making your project development effort a success. <B><I>We value your
feedback, input, comments, and criticisms</I></B> as these help to insure
that the PEG library, utility programs, and supporting documentation continue
to grow and improve to meet your needs.

<P>Unlimited technical support is provided to licensed users of PEG for
the term of the support contract. The normal support contract extends for
6 months from the date of purchase.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet2.jpg" HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=12> If you purchased PEG from
one of our integrated resellers, your first line of support is the reseller
from whom you purchased PEG. General questions regarding build procedures,
debugging, compiler settings, run-time libraries etc. should be directed
to your reseller whenever possible.

<P><IMG SRC="bullet2.jpg" HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=12> For technical questions of
a non-urgent nature, email support at Swell Software is the best solution.
We encourage you to provide a detailed description of the problem you are
reporting or question you have. If possible it is also beneficial to include
the related application level code that is not working as you expect. In
most cases we will duplicate your problem before generating a fix to insure
that the problem is corrected. <B><I>E-mail support requests are always
answered within 4 work-hours of receipt.</I></B>

<P>Send your E-mail support requests to:&nbsp; <A HREF="mailto:support@swellsoftware.com">support@swellsoftware.com</A>
