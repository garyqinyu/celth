<TR>
<TD>PSF_ACCEPTS_FOCUS</TD>

<TD COLSPAN="2">This flag indicates that the object will become the receiver
of input events when selected. The application level software can modify
this flag, but normally this is not advised. If this flag is modified for
a particular object, it is important for correct operation that ‘breaks’
in the tree of objects accepting focus are avoided. In other words, if
a parent window cannot accept focus, then neither should any of the window’s
child objects be allowed to accept focus.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>PSF_ALWAYS_ON_TOP</TD>

<TD>This flag insures that the object is always on top of its siblings.
The application level software can modify this flag.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>PSF_CURRENT</TD>

<TD>This flag indicates that the object is in the current branch of the
display tree. If the object is a leaf object (i.e. it has no children)
and it is current, then it is the object which will receive keyboard input
messages.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>PSF_DRAG_SOURCE</TD>

<TD>This flag, when set, allows the object to be dragged from its current
parent and dropped on another parent object. This flag has no effect in
the current library implementation. The application level software can
modify this flag.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>PSF_DRAG_TARGET</TD>

<TD>This flag, when set, indicates the object accepts objects which have
been dragged from another source. This flag has no effect in the current
library implementation. The application level software can modify this
flag.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>PSF_MOVEABLE</TD>

<TD>This flag determines whether or not an object can be moved. The application
level software can modify this flag.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>PSF_NONCLIENT</TD>

<TD>This flag , when set, allows a child object to draw outside the client
area of its parent. The application level software can modify this flag
after the object is constructed but before the object is displayed.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>PSF_SELECTABLE</TD>

<TD>This flag is tested by PegPresentationManager to determine if an object
is enabled and allowed to receive input messages. The application level
software can modify this flag.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>PSF_SIZEABLE</TD>

<TD>This flag determines whether or not an object can be resized. . The
application level software can modify this flag.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>PSF_TAB_STOP</TD>

<TD>This flag determines whether or not an object receives input focus
when the 'tab' key is received. This flag is enabled by default for PegButton
objects. Also enabled for editable PegString and PegTextBox objects. Enabled
for PegPrompt objects that can receive focus. The application software
can modify this flag.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>PSF_VIEWPORT</TD>

<TD>This flag, when set, instructs PegPresentationManager that the object
should be given a private screen viewport. Objects that have a viewport
are drawn differently than objects that do not have a viewport. In general,
large objects or objects which have a very complex drawing routine should
be given viewports, while small or simple objects should not. By default
all PegWindow derived objects receive viewports, and all other objects
do not. This flag should not be changed except immediately after the object
is constructed.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>PSF_VISIBLE</TD>

<TD>The object is visible on the screen. This flag should not be modified
by the application level software. Clearing or setting this flag will not
have the effect of removing or displaying the object. The PegThing member
functions Add and Remove are used for that purpose.</TD>
